You can not only watch the simulated livestream of our SeeTurtle, but also learn about the global microplastics problem, learn about how we engineered our solution, as well as how you can 'donate' to support our cause!

## The Problem
Our project SeeTurtle tackles the problem theme of waste management using the three technology types of software platforms, internet of things and artificial intelligence. According to the UN SDG12, 5 trillion plastic bags are thrown away each year and many end up in the oceans.

Team WhaleFood feels strongly about focusing our effort to reduce the amount of waste in our precious oceans. We acknowledge many valiant efforts to clean up floating garbage patches which are making headway. We therefore would like to focus our project on a more unseen waste problem: microplastics.

Microplastics are extremely small pieces of plastic debris in the environment which are very difficult to remove. Despite being hard to spot with our naked eyes, microplastics can carry a range of contaminants such as trace metals and some potentially harmful organic chemicals causing cancer in humans and killing 100 million marine mammals each year.

## The Solution
Our solution SeeTurtle is a robotic turtle which travels the ocean, filtering microplastics as it swims. It is battery powered and has solar panels on its shell to reduce its carbon footprint. We have also developed a web app that livestreams its dives in order to raise awareness of the amount of plastics removed.

### The Device
Our SeeTurtle includes a buoyancy device in the form of a pressurised air tank. The filtration system of our SeeTurtle uses activated carbon fibres in order to filter out microplastics. The antenna behind the head of the SeeTurtle transmits the livestream to our website.

### The Web App
Our web app’s main goal is to livestream our turtle’s underwater POV as well as display statistics about microplastics filtered and trash seen to raise awareness about how plastics are polluting our oceans.

Our web app is built with Nextjs and TypeScript to support static site generation for the educational content as well as client-side rendering for the livestream. We also used Tailwind for the CSS framework while Firebase is used to store turtle data, plastic statistics, donation amounts and to support user authentication. Finally, our website is hosted on Vercel.

## The Unique Selling Points
### 1. Biomimicry
Our solution is modelled after sea turtles for efficiency and to reduce disruption to ecosystems

### 2. AI-powered
Computer vision helps us to differentiate harmful plastics from living organisms

### 3. Battery-Electric
Zero emissions to minimise carbon footprint

### 4. Solar power
Renewable energy ensures our solution has minimal carbon footprint

### 5. Livestreamed everywhere
To raise awareness on microplastics as education is a crucial part of the solution

### 6. Consumer Interaction
Our supporters can comment on our website or donate to us!

## The Challenges

As none of us are from an engineering background, we found it daunting to come up with a solution that incorporates not just software technologies but hardware as well. As such, we had a difficult time coming up with the CAD models to prototype our product whilst simultaneously coming up with a functional Nextjs SPA linked to a Firestore backend that is not just aesthetic but useful as well. Additionally, ideating, conceptualizing, designing and developing under such a tight deadline was stress-inducing though exhilarating.

##The Accomplishments and Learning Points
This being our first time participating in a 24 hour hackathon, we are really proud of how far we've come. From designing an aesthetically pleasing front-end to coming up with a CAD prototype model and filming a business pitch, we have definitely enjoyed the entire development process thus far.

We learnt the basics of CAD through TinkerCAD and persevered through all the challenges. In addition, we also conducted extensive research on the dire situation of microplastics in our oceans.

## What's next for SeeTurtle - Team WhaleFood

We dream of deploying SeeTurtles across the globe to clean microplastics in all oceans across the globe.

In the future we also plan to design robo-SeeWhale motherships where our SeeTurtles can also come home to dock and charge

We also envision our SeeWhales as capable of capturing larger pieces of plastic waste.
